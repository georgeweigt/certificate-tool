Functions for analyzing certificate files.

The main function is a demo.

To build and run:

	cd src
	make
	./ctool

Check that certificate A is signed by B:

	./ctool check A.pem B.pem

Print a private key:

	./ctool key key.pem

Sign certificate A with B and save as C:

	./ctool sign A.pem B.pem key.pem | tee C.pem

There are scripts in the tools directory for creating certificates.
